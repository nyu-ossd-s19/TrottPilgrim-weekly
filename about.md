## About Me
I'm Thomas Lim, also known by my handle "TrottPilgrim" (which is sort of embarassing at this point because it's not similar to my actual name at all, but the handle is too precious to me now to give up). I am a CS student interested in game and web development, and writing about those things. I am not good at any of the things I'm interested in.

## Other Stuff
I love to bake! But I don't like to post pictures of what I bake because I was raised on neopets.
