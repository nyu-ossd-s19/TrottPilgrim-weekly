## Kevin Fleming

One thing that I found pretty interesting about Kevin Fleming's talk is that Bloomberg tries to not use an inner source and develop proprietary stuff. Instead, they actively and openly contribute to open source projects, and those engineers at Bloomberg are paid to contribute to open source projects, as their *job*. It was also surprising to learn that Bloomberg also apparently suggests new features in languages and implements them, like  the better Javascript private fields in TypeScript.

## Blockly

I really haven't been writing updates because I really stink at finding the time during the week to actually make pull requests. I have emailed the contact on the Blockly team (thanks Joanna!) twice on behalf of the team, asking about any big problems they might need help with, but I have not recieved a response yet.
