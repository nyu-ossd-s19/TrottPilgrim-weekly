title: Week 11

I've procrastinated far too long for this blog post.
This week, we mostly prepared to give a presentation on Blockly for the last. We were unable to find much time to work on the modal variable feature request because of other obligations. I did, however, note that the mockup of the image was a reference to a Gilbert and Sullivan play called Pirates of Penzance, specifically the song "I am the very model of a modern major-general." Last week, we watched the presentations for Caprine, Home Assistant, and Free Code Camp (team 0).
