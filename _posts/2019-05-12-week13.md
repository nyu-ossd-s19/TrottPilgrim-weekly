# Last week
- So we're finally here... the last week of classes.
- Last week, we gave a presentation and also watched presentations.
- Beagle, Scikit-Learn, Vue.js, Gatsby, and FreeCodeCamp (group 1) all had fairly interesting presentations
  - A common thread though seems to be that it's easier to work with smaller Open Source projects because you don't have to actively compete with others to work on issues and create pull requests.
- Reflecting on Blockly, I feel like we could have moved faster and done more.
- I don't feel like I've done a ton over the semester for the course, but watching the presentations and attending the meetups have really made me quite interested in continuing to work on them in the future.
- Oh, and I also attended the OSI meetup last week along with a bunch of my classmates. I enjoyed the talks about skills to learn and flags to watch out for in open source spaces, and overall the talks were very encouraging to someone like me, who is overall not very confident in their own ability, that there is space for all types of people in open source places.
  - I enjoyed the talk except for that one guy who was bragging about his certifications.
