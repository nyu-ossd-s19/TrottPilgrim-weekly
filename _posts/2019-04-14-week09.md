### "Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away."
- I always like to compare maxims and stuff to non-software. Coco Chanel had a saying- ```Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off```. 
- A well-designed thing implies some sort of elegance, so the two ideas in the original statement (nothing to add, nothing to take away) aren't contradictory. A program that is not underfeatured, but also not bloated.

### "When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend."

- I don't know what turing completeness is. According to yahoo answers user [green meklar](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20111222041836AAVkuWl) the quote is meant to be a tounge-in-cheek slight towards non turing complete languages, meaning that in order to be useful, they disguise the lack of usefulness with syntactic sugar.
- Syntactic sugar I'm conflicted on. It's literally a design decision that is meant to literally make a language more usable for humans,but it also complicates a language, creating unpleasant interactions and abstractions cause blind usage.
