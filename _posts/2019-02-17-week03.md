## Reflecting
Ultimately, Candela was a bit of a janky mess of an extension, as I had alluded to in last week's blog post. Some of my favorite extensions I saw last week in the in-class were: [notepad](https://github.com/gracey715/notepad-team-3) by [Grace Yang](https://github.com/gracey715) and [memeify](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s19/memeify-team-1) by Team 1. Notepad managd to do a lot with just one person working on it, which is more than what I could say about the extension I worked on. Memeify was a bad idea made good in execution. Good stuff all around! As for Candela...

## Candela
My experience making our extension was a little frustrating, but probably a lot of it was my fault. Jim honestly did most of the work, because he was the one that had the most experience out of our team, and he was the one that had the clearest idea out of all of us wht he wanted the extension to do. Jonathan, meanwhile, managed to make a decent icon that I felt was pretty good! Working with a team was kind of difficult, because we were mostly chatting between each other on Facebook Messenger and sharing snippets of code through screengrabs, which doesn't seem like the most efficient way of going about it, but Github doesn't have (and probably doesn't *need*) an integrated chat system to the best of my knowledge. Yeah, so, it could have been better.
