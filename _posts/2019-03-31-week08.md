## Cathedrals and Bazaars
Essentially, one paradigm of working on software is as a singular wizard-lord, a single architect of the software that carefully considers each brick of the proverbial cathedral before putting it into the wall.
Bazaar-type development is more chaotic, delegating tasks to whomever walks into the door that all contribute their own touches into an equally beautiful piece of artwork. Both work, and there are examples of both being successful paths towards good software. I personally feel like the Cathedral approach is ideally preferable, but ultimately futile the larger the scale of the project.

## Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
- This one reminds me of non software stuff- like how the modern design of dishwashers were only invented because a housewife somewhere decided that they wanted to build a better dishwasher that didn't chip her fine china.
- Esoteric needs are sometimes the gateway to mainstream needs!

## "Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow."
- This one is like the popular writers' credo, to write a shitty first draft. A shitty first draft is always the first step towards really understanding a problem.
