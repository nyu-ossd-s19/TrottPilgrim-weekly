I did not attend the lecture by Christos Bacharakis because I was sick.

# Godot Engine's MIT License
The MIT license seems fairly generous: the templates I could find of this license allow rights holders to be extremely flexible with what rights they can grant to collaborators.
```
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software.
```
The entire license is almost contained in just these two paragraphs. People can modify, distribute, sublicense, and even sell Godot if they include the copyright notice and permission notice along with it.
