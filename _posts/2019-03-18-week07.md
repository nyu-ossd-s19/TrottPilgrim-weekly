title: Week 7

I had food poisoning last week and I totally forgot to write a blog post for that week.
I've joined the Blockly project group with Jim Jiang, Tiara Tan, and Antony Sunwoo.
I joined this group because I work at a middle school with a math teacher that wants to teach her students Scratch, the visual programming language.
Blockly is sort of Google's implementation of that idea.
